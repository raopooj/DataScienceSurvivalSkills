math_quiz.py can be used to quiz the user on basic mathematical tasks.  
Working : For a random number and random operand, the program asks for the userinput. It calculates the expected answer using inbuilt math functions. If the expected answer and the userinput are equal, 1 point is awarded.  

The code has 3 functions to achieve its aim.
1. gen_rand_int function is used to generate random integer values 
2. get_operator is used to generate random operand 
3. calculate function is used to perform the operation (generated from get_operator function) on the numbers (generated from gen_rand_int function) and calculate the mathematical result. 


tests_math_quiz.py has unit tests to check the correctness of each of these functions.
